# Sentiment_analysis_Vaccine_Myth
This is a repository created to do the sentiment analysis on the vaccine myths on a subreddit. VaccineMyths (r/VaccineMyths), is a subreddit where people discuss about various Vaccine Myths.  The data might contain a small percent of harsh language, the posts were not filtered. I came to know about this dataset and tasks from Kaggle website.
